I built this calendar in PHP, JavaScript, and CSS using an existing calendar that was initially designed by our Marketing Department.

This calendar was built in PHP as a part of the custom MVP Online plugin I built. The calendar has a dropdown to change which site you are viewing, and lets you see 7 days a time with arrows to change the week.

The calendar was built as a shortcode section so it can be included on any page. The shortcode arguments allows you to set which clubs to show in the dropdown, or hide the dropdown if only one site is added.

While logged in you can use the buttons on individual upcoming entries to reserve a spot in the class or cancel a reservation if you are already enrolled.

4G Athletic uses the WordPress plugin WooCommerce to sell items through their website. I directly developed the product page and added the products to the site. I also set up shipping rules through the WooCommerce plugin’s settings.

The plugin’s design originally did not fit the rest of the website so I created a child theme for the site which overwrites the CSS for the shop and product pages.

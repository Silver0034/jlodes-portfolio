Well-Fit by MVP was a site created by MVP Sports Clubâ€™s Marketing Director which I oversaw site maintenance and content updates for. Specifically, I was responsible for keeping the site updated, assisting in header creation, and in setting up the activity calendar. The activity calendar is actually the same as the [group fitness calendar](/blog/group-fitness-calendar/) featured on the regular MVP Sports Clubs website.

The MVP Corporate website was set up in WordPress by the MVP Marketing Director and I helped in setting up the headers and the corporate leaders section. It was initially set up as a part of the WordPress theme but it was requested that lightboxes were added with extra information about the individuals featured in the section.

I created a child theme for the site and added in functionality to add text for each leader and used JavaScript to create and display the lightboxes as you open them.

I first designed the memberships sales pages in Adobe XD. Utilizing PHP, JavaScript, and SASS the pages were then developed. As the user completes each section multiple slides scroll past the single page. All of the information is pulled dynamically from the various APIâ€™s at MVP Sports Clubs. It uses a custom cart API that I designed with a partner on the development team. My responsibilities were to architect the responses while she wrote the API.
